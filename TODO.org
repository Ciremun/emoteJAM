- [-] Alpha
  - [X] Replace rendering preview with spining wheel on rendering
  - [ ] Get rid of the "Render" buttons
    - Just rerender every time something changes
      - With WebAssembly sped up gif.js this will be especially nice
  - [X] When you upload big image it takes up a lot of space on the screen
  - [ ] Prevent several concurrent render processess
  - [X] Rename JAM to Laughing
    - JAM is actually infeasiable rn
  - [ ] Give "clowning" filter a better name
  - [X] Rendered GIF has no transparency
  - [-] Presets
    - [-] Hop
      - [X] Perfectly looped timing
      - [X] No bumping on the edges
      - [X] Flipping the texture according to the direction
      - [ ] Going out of bounds of edges
      - [ ] Customizable flipping
    - [ ] Bounce
    - [ ] Pepego

      - Just animate UV
  - [ ] More usable UI layout (does not have to be pretty)
    - [ ] Replace the Lorem with actually useful texts
    - [ ] Add copyright footer
    - [ ] Dark Theme
    - [ ] Favicon
    - [ ] Widget elements are too small
  - [ ] Smooth progress report on the first phase of the emote
    rendering (the OpenGL one)
- [ ] Beta
  - [ ] Timing of the animation is screwed on blur event
  - [ ] Customize parameters of the GIF rendering
    - [ ] FPS
    - [ ] Quality
    - [ ] Resolution
    - [ ] Custom transparency color
    - ...
  - [ ] Special built-in "clean up" filters that are always applied before handing the texture to the preset shaders
    - Like the one we did to remove weird pixels from Jebaited
  - [ ] Original aspect ratio of the input image is not preserved
    - I guess it should be solved on the level of the "filters"
      - So we need to pass the size of the textures to the filters as uniforms
- [ ] Back-burner
  - [ ] Fork and rewrite gif.js in WebAssembly
    - Also get rid of the old coffee stuff
  - [ ] "Render & Upload to BTTV" button (should just automatically
    upload the newly generated emote on your BTTV account)
  - [ ] Download existing emotes from BTTV, FFZ and Twitch
    - In case of Twitch you can download them simply by their name
      cause it's unique (afaik) across the whole platform
  - [ ] Drag and drop image files
  - [ ] Custom shaders
    - Some random ideas
      - Store shaders in local storage
      - Store shaders in something gist
      - Export/import presets as a JSON file
  - [ ] Preset parameters
    - This is more for people who don't know shaders. Presets may have
      special custom parameters that can be modified with UI elements.
  - [ ] Ability to pause the animation
