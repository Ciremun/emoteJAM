- [-] Alpha
  - [ ] GIF rendering progress is not reported
  - [X] Preview window is upside down (the actual problem is
    gl.readPixel returns upside down image (because thank you OpenGL
    coordinate system) so we render upside down)
  - [X] "Render" button opens a new tab instead of downloading the emote
    - But that allows you to "preview" the rendered version
      - Embed the rendered version into the DOM of the current page
        and let the user save it if they are happy with it
  - [ ] Rendered GIF has no transparency
  - [ ] Customize parameters of the GIF rendering
    - [ ] FPS
    - [ ] Quality
    - ...
  - [ ] Presets
    - [ ] JAM
      - [ ] Perfectly looped timing
      - [ ] The headphones and the hand
    - [ ] Hop
      - [ ] Perfectly looped timing
      - [ ] No bumping on the edges
      - [ ] Flipping the texture according to the direction
  - [ ] More usable UI layout (does not have to be pretty)
    - [ ] Replace the Lorem with actually useful texts
    - [ ] Add copyright footer
    - [ ] Dark Theme
- [ ] Beta
- [ ] Back-burner
  - [ ] Fork and rewrite gif.js in WebAssembly
    - Also get rid of the old coffee stuff
  - [ ] "Render & Upload to BTTV" button (should just automatically
    upload the newly generated emote on your BTTV account)
  - [ ] Download existing emotes from BTTV, FFZ and Twitch
    - In case of Twitch you can download them simply by their name
      cause it's unique (afaik) across the whole platform
  - [ ] Drag and drop image files
  - [ ] Custom shaders
    - Some random ideas
      - Store shaders in local storage
      - Store shaders in something gist
      - Export/import presets as a JSON file
  - [ ] Preset parameters
    - This is more for people who don't know shaders. Presets may have
      special custom parameters that can be modified with UI elements.
